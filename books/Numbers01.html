    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v36">36</span> Of the children of Benjamin, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war: <span class="verse" id="v37">37</span> those who were counted of them, of the tribe of Benjamin, were thirty-five thousand four hundred.</p>

    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v44">44</span> These are those who were counted, whom Moses and Aaron counted, and the twelve men who were princes of Israel, each one for his fathers’ house. <span class="verse" id="v45">45</span> So all those who were counted of the children of Israel by their fathers’ houses, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war in Israel— <span class="verse" id="v46">46</span> all those who were counted were six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty. <span class="verse" id="v47">47</span> But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not counted among them. <span class="verse" id="v48">48</span> For Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span class="verse" id="v49">49</span> “Only the tribe of Levi you shall not count, neither shall you take a census of them among the children of Israel; <span class="verse" id="v50">50</span> but appoint the Levites over the Tabernacle of the Testimony, and over all its furnishings, and over all that belongs to it. They shall carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings; and they shall take care of it, and shall encamp around it. <span class="verse" id="v51">51</span> When the tabernacle is to move, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be set up, the Levites shall set it up. The stranger who comes near shall be put to death. <span class="verse" id="v52">52</span> The children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, according to their divisions. <span class="verse" id="v53">53</span> But the Levites shall encamp around the Tabernacle of the Testimony, that there may be no wrath on the congregation of the children of Israel. The Levites shall be responsible for the Tabernacle of the Testimony.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v54">54</span> Thus the children of Israel did. According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so they did.</p>
