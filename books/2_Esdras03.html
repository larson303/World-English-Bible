    <h2 class="chapterlabel">3</h2>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v1">1</span> In the thirtieth year after the ruin of the city, I Salathiel, also called Esdras, was in Babylon, and lay troubled upon my bed, and my thoughts came up over my heart, <span class="verse" id="v2">2</span> for I saw the desolation of Zion and the wealth of those who lived at Babylon. <span class="verse" id="v3">3</span> My spirit was very agitated, so that I began to speak words full of fear to the Most High, and said, <span class="verse" id="v4">4</span> “O sovereign Lord, didn’t you speak at the beginning when you formed the earth—and that yourself alone—and commanded the dust <span class="verse" id="v5">5</span> and it gave you Adam, a body without a soul? Yet it was the workmanship of your hands, and you breathed into him the breath of life, and he was made alive in your presence. <span class="verse" id="v6">6</span> You led him into the garden which your right hand planted before the earth appeared. <span class="verse" id="v7">7</span> You gave him your one commandment, which he transgressed, and immediately you appointed death for him and his descendants. From him were born nations, tribes, peoples, and kindred without number. <span class="verse" id="v8">8</span> Every nation walked after their own will, did ungodly things in your sight, and despised your commandments, and you didn’t hinder them. <span class="verse" id="v9">9</span> Nevertheless, again in process of time, you brought the flood on those who lived in the world and destroyed them. <span class="verse" id="v10">10</span> It came to pass that the same thing happened to them. Just as death came to Adam, so was the flood to these. <span class="verse" id="v11">11</span> Nevertheless, you left one of them, Noah with his household, and all the righteous men who descended from him.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v12">12</span> “It came to pass that when those who lived upon the earth began to multiply, they also multiplied children, peoples, and many nations, and began again to be more ungodly than their ancestors. <span class="verse" id="v13">13</span> It came to pass, when they did wickedly before you, you chose one from among them, whose name was Abraham. <span class="verse" id="v14">14</span> You loved, and to him only you showed the end of the times secretly by night, <span class="verse" id="v15">15</span> and made an everlasting covenant with him, promising him that you would never forsake his descendants. To him, you gave Isaac, and to Isaac you gave Jacob and Esau. <span class="verse" id="v16">16</span> You set apart Jacob for yourself, but rejected Esau. Jacob became a great multitude. <span class="verse" id="v17">17</span> It came to pass that when you led his descendants out of Egypt, you brought them up to Mount Sinai. <span class="verse" id="v18">18</span> You bowed the heavens also, shook the earth, moved the whole world, made the depths tremble, and troubled the age. <span class="verse" id="v19">19</span> Your glory went through four gates, of fire, of earthquake, of wind, and of ice, that you might give the law to the descendants of Jacob, and the commandment to the descendants of Israel.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v20">20</span> “Yet you didn’t take away from them their wicked heart, that your law might produce fruit in them. <span class="verse" id="v21">21</span> For the first Adam, burdened with a wicked heart transgressed and was overcome, as were all who are descended from him. <span class="verse" id="v22">22</span> Thus disease was made permanent. The law was in the heart of the people along with the wickedness of the root. So the good departed away and that which was wicked remained. <span class="verse" id="v23">23</span> So the times passed away, and the years were brought to an end. Then you raised up a servant, called David, <span class="verse" id="v24">24</span> whom you commanded to build a city to your name, and to offer burnt offerings to you in it from what is yours. <span class="verse" id="v25">25</span> When this was done many years, then those who inhabited the city did evil, <span class="verse" id="v26">26</span> in all things doing as Adam and all his generations had done, for they also had a wicked heart. <span class="verse" id="v27">27</span> So you gave your city over into the hands of your enemies.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v28">28</span> “Then I said in my heart, ‘Are their deeds of those who inhabit Babylon any better? Is that why it gained dominion over Zion?’ <span class="verse" id="v29">29</span> For it came to pass when I came here, that I also saw impieties without number, and my soul saw many sinners in this thirtieth year, so that my heart failed me. <span class="verse" id="v30">30</span> For I have seen how you endure them sinning, and have spared those who act ungodly, and have destroyed your people, and have preserved your enemies; <span class="verse" id="v31">31</span> and you have not shown how your way may be comprehended. Are the deeds of Babylon better than those of Zion? <span class="verse" id="v32">32</span> Or is there any other nation that knows you beside Israel? Or what tribes have so believed your covenants as these tribes of Jacob? <span class="verse" id="v33">33</span> Yet their reward doesn’t appear, and their labor has no fruit, for I have gone here and there through the nations, and I see that they abound in wealth, and don’t think about your commandments. <span class="verse" id="v34">34</span> Weigh therefore our iniquities now in the balance, and theirs also who dwell in the world, and so will it be found which way the scale inclines. <span class="verse" id="v35">35</span> Or when was it that they who dwell on the earth have not sinned in your sight? Or what nation has kept your commandments so well? <span class="verse" id="v36">36</span> You will find some men by name who have kept your precepts, but you won’t find nations.”</p>
