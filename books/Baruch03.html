    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v1">1</span> O Lord Almighty, you God of Israel, the soul in anguish and the troubled spirit cries to you. <span class="verse" id="v2">2</span> Hear, O Lord, and have mercy; for you are a merciful God. Yes, have mercy upon us, because we have sinned before you. <span class="verse" id="v3">3</span> For you are enthroned forever, and we keep perishing. <span class="verse" id="v4">4</span> O Lord Almighty, you God of Israel, hear now the prayer of the dead Israelites, and of the children of those who were sinners before you, who didn’t listen to the voice of you their God; because of this, these plagues cling to us. <span class="verse" id="v5">5</span> Don’t remember the iniquities of our fathers, but remember your power and your name at this time. <span class="verse" id="v6">6</span> For you are the Lord our God, and we will praise you, O Lord. <span class="verse" id="v7">7</span> For this cause, you have put your fear in our hearts, to the intent that we should call upon your name. We will praise you in our captivity, for we have called to mind all the iniquity of our fathers who sinned before you. <span class="verse" id="v8">8</span> Behold, we are yet this day in our captivity where you have scattered us, for a reproach and a curse, and to be subject to penalty according to all the iniquities of our fathers who departed from the Lord our God.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v9">9</span> Hear, O Israel, the commandments of life! Give ear to understand wisdom! <span class="verse" id="v10">10</span> How is it, O Israel, that you are in your enemies’ land, that you have become old in a strange country, that you are defiled with the dead, <span class="verse" id="v11">11</span> that you are counted with those who are in Hades? <span class="verse" id="v12">12</span> You have forsaken the fountain of wisdom. <span class="verse" id="v13">13</span> If you had walked in the way of God, you would have dwelled in peace forever. <span class="verse" id="v14">14</span> Learn where there is wisdom, where there is strength, and where there is understanding, that you may also know where there is length of days and life, where there is the light of the eyes and peace. <span class="verse" id="v15">15</span> Who has found out her place? Who has come into her treasuries? <span class="verse" id="v16">16</span> Where are the princes of the heathen, and those who ruled the beasts that are on the earth, <span class="verse" id="v17">17</span> those who had their pastime with the fowls of the air, and those who hoarded up silver and gold, in which people trust, and of their getting there is no end? <span class="verse" id="v18">18</span> For those who diligently sought silver, and were so anxious, and whose works are past finding out, <span class="verse" id="v19">19</span> they have vanished and gone down to Hades, and others have come up in their place.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v20">20</span> Younger men have seen the light and lived upon the earth, but they haven’t known the way of knowledge, <span class="verse" id="v21">21</span> nor understood its paths. Their children haven’t embraced it. They are far off from their way. <span class="verse" id="v22">22</span> It has not been heard of in Canaan, neither has it been seen in Teman. <span class="verse" id="v23">23</span> The sons also of Agar who seek understanding, which are in the land, the merchants of Merran and Teman, and the authors of fables, and the searchers out of understanding—none of these have known the way of wisdom or remembered her paths.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v24">24</span> O Israel, how great is the house of God! How large is the place of his possession! <span class="verse" id="v25">25</span> It is great and has no end. It is high and unmeasurable. <span class="verse" id="v26">26</span> Giants were born that were famous of old, great of stature, and expert in war. <span class="verse" id="v27">27</span> God didn’t choose these, nor did he give the way of knowledge to them, <span class="verse" id="v28">28</span> so they perished, because they had no wisdom. They perished through their own foolishness. <span class="verse" id="v29">29</span> Who has gone up into heaven, taken her, and brought her down from the clouds? <span class="verse" id="v30">30</span> Who has gone over the sea, found her, and will bring her for choice gold? <span class="verse" id="v31">31</span> There is no one who knows her way, nor any who comprehend her path. <span class="verse" id="v32">32</span> But he that knows all things knows her, he found her out with his understanding. He who prepared the earth for all time has filled it with four-footed beasts. <span class="verse" id="v33">33</span> It is he who sends forth the light, and it goes. He called it, and it obeyed him with fear. <span class="verse" id="v34">34</span> The stars shone in their watches, and were glad. When he called them, they said, “Here we are.” They shone with gladness to him who made them. <span class="verse" id="v35">35</span> This is our God. No other can be compared to him. <span class="verse" id="v36">36</span> He has found out all the way of knowledge, and has given it to Jacob his servant and to Israel who is loved by him. <span class="verse" id="v37">37</span> Afterward she appeared upon earth, and lived with men.</p>
