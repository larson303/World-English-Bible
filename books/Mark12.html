    <h2 class="chapterlabel">12</h2>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v1">1</span> He began to speak to them in parables. <span class="wj">“A man planted a vineyard, put a hedge around it, dug a pit for the wine press, built a tower, rented it out to a farmer, and went into another country. </span> <span class="verse" id="v2">2</span> <span class="wj">When it was time, he sent a servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the vineyard. </span> <span class="verse" id="v3">3</span> <span class="wj">They took him, beat him, and sent him away empty. </span> <span class="verse" id="v4">4</span> <span class="wj">Again, he sent another servant to them; and they threw stones at him, wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated. </span> <span class="verse" id="v5">5</span> <span class="wj">Again he sent another, and they killed him, and many others, beating some, and killing some. </span> <span class="verse" id="v6">6</span> <span class="wj">Therefore still having one, his beloved son, he sent him last to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ </span> <span class="verse" id="v7">7</span> <span class="wj">But those farmers said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ </span> <span class="verse" id="v8">8</span> <span class="wj">They took him, killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard. </span> <span class="verse" id="v9">9</span> <span class="wj">What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others. </span> <span class="verse" id="v10">10</span> <span class="wj">Haven’t you even read this Scripture:</span></p>
    <p class="q"><span class="wj">‘The stone which the builders rejected</span></p>
    <p class="q2"><span class="wj">was made the head of the corner.</span></p>
    <p class="q"><span class="verse" id="v11">11</span> <span class="wj">This was from the Lord.</span></p>
    <p class="q2"><span class="wj">It is marvelous in our eyes’?”</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark" title=" Psalm 118:22-23">*</a></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v12">12</span> They tried to seize him, but they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them. They left him and went away. <span class="verse" id="v13">13</span> They sent some of the Pharisees and the Herodians to him, that they might trap him with words. <span class="verse" id="v14">14</span> When they had come, they asked him, “Teacher, we know that you are honest, and don’t defer to anyone; for you aren’t partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? <span class="verse" id="v15">15</span> Shall we give, or shall we not give?”</p>
    <p class="p">But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, <span class="wj">“Why do you test me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see it.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v16">16</span> They brought it.</p>
    <p class="p">He said to them, <span class="wj">“Whose is this image and inscription?”</span></p>
    <p class="p">They said to him, “Caesar’s.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v17">17</span> Jesus answered them, <span class="wj">“Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”</span></p>
    <p class="p">They marveled greatly at him.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v18">18</span> Some Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to him. They asked him, saying, <span class="verse" id="v19">19</span> “Teacher, Moses wrote to us, ‘If a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife behind him, and leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother.’ <span class="verse" id="v20">20</span> There were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and dying left no offspring. <span class="verse" id="v21">21</span> The second took her, and died, leaving no children behind him. The third likewise; <span class="verse" id="v22">22</span> and the seven took her and left no children. Last of all the woman also died. <span class="verse" id="v23">23</span> In the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as a wife.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v24">24</span> Jesus answered them, <span class="wj">“Isn’t this because you are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God? </span> <span class="verse" id="v25">25</span> <span class="wj">For when they will rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. </span> <span class="verse" id="v26">26</span> <span class="wj">But about the dead, that they are raised, haven’t you read in the book of Moses about the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?</span><a href="#FN2" class="notemark" title=" Exodus 3:6">*</a> <span class="verse" id="v27">27</span> <span class="wj">He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are therefore badly mistaken.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v28">28</span> One of the scribes came and heard them questioning together, and knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, “Which commandment is the greatest of all?”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v29">29</span> Jesus answered, <span class="wj">“The greatest is: ‘Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. </span> <span class="verse" id="v30">30</span> <span class="wj">You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’</span><a href="#FN3" class="notemark" title=" Deuteronomy 6:4-5">*</a> <span class="wj">This is the first commandment. </span> <span class="verse" id="v31">31</span> <span class="wj">The second is like this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’</span><a href="#FN4" class="notemark" title=" Leviticus 19:18">*</a> <span class="wj">There is no other commandment greater than these.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v32">32</span> The scribe said to him, “Truly, teacher, you have said well that he is one, and there is none other but he; <span class="verse" id="v33">33</span> and to love him with all the heart, with all the understanding, all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v34">34</span> When Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, <span class="wj">“You are not far from God’s Kingdom.”</span></p>
    <p class="p">No one dared ask him any question after that. <span class="verse" id="v35">35</span> Jesus responded, as he taught in the temple, <span class="wj">“How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David? </span> <span class="verse" id="v36">36</span> <span class="wj">For David himself said in the Holy Spirit,</span></p>
    <p class="q"><span class="wj">‘The Lord said to my Lord,</span></p>
    <p class="q2"><span class="wj">“Sit at my right hand,</span></p>
    <p class="q2"><span class="wj">until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet.” ’</span><a href="#FN5" class="notemark" title=" Psalm 110:1">*</a></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v37">37</span> <span class="wj">Therefore David himself calls him Lord, so how can he be his son?” </span></p>
    <p class="p">The common people heard him gladly. <span class="verse" id="v38">38</span> In his teaching he said to them, <span class="wj">“Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and to get greetings in the marketplaces, </span> <span class="verse" id="v39">39</span> <span class="wj">and to get the best seats in the synagogues and the best places at feasts, </span> <span class="verse" id="v40">40</span> <span class="wj">those who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v41">41</span> Jesus sat down opposite the treasury and saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury. Many who were rich cast in much. <span class="verse" id="v42">42</span> A poor widow came and she cast in two small brass coins,<a href="#FN6" class="notemark" title=" literally, lepta (or widow’s mites). Lepta are very small brass coins worth half a quadrans each, which is a quarter of the copper assarion. Lepta are worth less than 1% of an agricultural worker’s daily wages.">†</a> which equal a quadrans coin.<a href="#FN7" class="notemark" title=" A quadrans is a coin worth about 1/64 of a denarius. A denarius is about one day’s wages for an agricultural laborer.">‡</a> <span class="verse" id="v43">43</span> He called his disciples to himself and said to them, <span class="wj">“Most certainly I tell you, this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury, </span> <span class="verse" id="v44">44</span> <span class="wj">for they all gave out of their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, gave all that she had to live on.”</span></p>
