    <h2 class="chapterlabel">1</h2>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v1">1</span> After Alexander the Macedonian, the son of Philip, who came out of the land of Chittim, and struck Darius king of the Persians and Medes, it came to pass, after he had struck him, that he reigned in his place, in former time, over<a href="#FN1" class="notemark" title=" That is, the Greek Empire. Compare 1 Maccabees 1:10 and 1 Maccabees 6:2. ">†</a> Greece. <span class="verse" id="v2">2</span> He fought many battles, won many strongholds, killed the kings of the earth, <span class="verse" id="v3">3</span> went through to the ends of the earth, and took spoils of a multitude of nations. The earth was quiet before him. He was exalted. His heart was lifted up. <span class="verse" id="v4">4</span> He gathered together an exceedingly strong army and ruled over countries, nations, and principalities, and they paid him tribute.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v5">5</span> After these things he fell sick, and perceived that he was going to die. <span class="verse" id="v6">6</span> He called his honorable servants, which had been brought up with him from his youth, and he divided to them his kingdom while he was still alive. <span class="verse" id="v7">7</span> Alexander reigned twelve years, then he died. <span class="verse" id="v8">8</span> Then his servants ruled, each one in his place. <span class="verse" id="v9">9</span> They all put crowns upon themselves after he was dead, and so did their sons after them many years; and they multiplied evils in the earth.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v10">10</span> There came out of them a sinful root, Antiochus Epiphanes, son of Antiochus the king, who had been a hostage at Rome, and he reigned in<a href="#FN2" class="notemark" title=" circa B.C. 176. ">‡</a> the one hundred thirty seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v11">11</span> In those days transgressors of the law came out of Israel and persuaded many, saying, let’s go make a covenant with the<a href="#FN3" class="notemark" title=" Or, nations: and so throughout this book.">§</a> Gentiles around us; for since we were separated from them many evils have befallen us. <span class="verse" id="v12">12</span> That proposal was good in their eyes. <span class="verse" id="v13">13</span> Some of the people eagerly went to the king, and he authorized them to observe the ordinances of the<a href="#FN4" class="notemark" title=" Or, nations: and so throughout this book.">†</a> Gentiles. <span class="verse" id="v14">14</span> So<a href="#FN5" class="notemark" title=" See 2 Maccabees 4:9, 12. ">‡</a> they built a gymnasium in Jerusalem according to the laws of the<a href="#FN6" class="notemark" title=" Or, nations: and so throughout this book. ">§</a> Gentiles. <span class="verse" id="v15">15</span> They made themselves uncircumcised, forsook the holy covenant, joined themselves to the<a href="#FN7" class="notemark" title=" Or, nations: and so throughout this book ">†</a> Gentiles, and sold themselves to do evil.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v16">16</span> The kingdom was established in the sight of Antiochus, and he planned to reign over Egypt, that he might reign over both kingdoms. <span class="verse" id="v17">17</span> He entered into Egypt with a<a href="#FN8" class="notemark" title=" Gr. heavy. ">‡</a> great multitude, with chariots, with elephants, with cavalry, and with a great<a href="#FN9" class="notemark" title=" Or, armament ">§</a> navy. <span class="verse" id="v18">18</span> He made war against Ptolemy king of Egypt. Ptolemy was put to shame before him, and fled; and many fell wounded to death. <span class="verse" id="v19">19</span> They took possession of the strong cities in the land of Egypt, and he took the spoils of Egypt.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v20">20</span> Antiochus, after he had defeated Egypt, returned in<a href="#FN10" class="notemark" title=" circa B.C. 170. See 2 Maccabees 5:11-16. ">†</a> the one hundred forty third year, and went up against Israel and Jerusalem with a<a href="#FN11" class="notemark" title=" Gr. heavy. ">‡</a> great multitude, <span class="verse" id="v21">21</span> and entered presumptuously into the sanctuary, and took the golden altar, the lampstand for the light, and all its utensils. <span class="verse" id="v22">22</span> He took the table of the show bread, the cups for the drink offerings, the bowls, the golden censers, the veil, the crowns, and the gold decoration on the front of the temple. He peeled it all off. <span class="verse" id="v23">23</span> He took the silver, the gold, and the precious vessels. He took the hidden treasures which he found. <span class="verse" id="v24">24</span> When he had taken all of these, he went away into his own land. He made a great slaughter, and spoke very arrogantly. <span class="verse" id="v25">25</span> Great mourning came upon Israel, in every place where they were. <span class="verse" id="v26">26</span> The rulers and elders groaned. The virgins and young men were made feeble. The beauty of the women was changed. <span class="verse" id="v27">27</span> Every bridegroom took up lamentation. She who sat in the marriage chamber was mourning. <span class="verse" id="v28">28</span> The land was moved for its inhabitants, and all the house of Jacob was clothed with shame.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v29">29</span> <a href="#FN12" class="notemark" title=" See 2 Maccabees 5:24. ">§</a>After two full years, the king sent a chief collector of tribute to the cities of Judah, and he came to Jerusalem with a<a href="#FN13" class="notemark" title=" Gr. heavy. ">†</a> great multitude. <span class="verse" id="v30">30</span> He spoke words of peace to them in subtlety, and they believed him. Then he fell upon the city suddenly, struck it very severely, and destroyed many people of Israel. <span class="verse" id="v31">31</span> He took the spoils of the city, set it on fire, and pulled down its houses and its walls on every side. <span class="verse" id="v32">32</span> They led captive the women and the children, and seized the livestock. <span class="verse" id="v33">33</span> Then they fortified the city of David with a large, strong wall and with strong towers, and it became their citadel. <span class="verse" id="v34">34</span> They put a sinful nation, transgressors of the law, there, and they strengthened themselves in it. <span class="verse" id="v35">35</span> They stored up weapons and food, and gathering together the spoils of Jerusalem, they stored them there, and they became a great menace. <span class="verse" id="v36">36</span> It became a place to lie in wait against the sanctuary, and an evil adversary to Israel continually. <span class="verse" id="v37">37</span> They shed innocent blood on every side of the sanctuary, and defiled the sanctuary. <span class="verse" id="v38">38</span> The inhabitants of Jerusalem fled because of them. She became a habitation of foreigners. She became foreign to those who were born in her, and her children forsook her. <span class="verse" id="v39">39</span> Her sanctuary was laid waste like a wilderness,<a href="#FN14" class="notemark" title=" See 2 Maccabees 6:6. ">‡</a> her feasts were turned into mourning, her Sabbaths into reproach, and her honor into contempt. <span class="verse" id="v40">40</span> According to her glory, so was her dishonor multiplied, and her exaltation was turned into mourning.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v41">41</span> King Antiochus wrote to his whole kingdom that all should be one people, <span class="verse" id="v42">42</span> and that each should forsake his own laws. All the nations agreed according to the word of the king. <span class="verse" id="v43">43</span> Many of Israel consented to his worship, sacrificed to the idols, and profaned the Sabbath. <span class="verse" id="v44">44</span> The king sent letters by the hand of messengers to Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, that they should follow laws strange to the land, <span class="verse" id="v45">45</span> and should forbid whole burnt offerings and sacrifice and drink offerings in the sanctuary; and should profane the Sabbaths and feasts, <span class="verse" id="v46">46</span> and pollute the sanctuary and those who were holy; <span class="verse" id="v47">47</span> that they should build altars, and temples, and shrines for idols, and should sacrifice swine’s flesh and unclean animals; <span class="verse" id="v48">48</span> and that they should leave their sons uncircumcised, that they should make their souls abominable with all manner of uncleanness and profanation; <span class="verse" id="v49">49</span> so that they might forget the law, and change all the ordinances. <span class="verse" id="v50">50</span> Whoever doesn’t do according to the word of the king, he shall die. <span class="verse" id="v51">51</span> According to all these words wrote he to his whole kingdom. He appointed overseers over all the people, and he commanded the cities of Judah to sacrifice, city by city. <span class="verse" id="v52">52</span> From the people were gathered together to them many, everyone who had forsaken the law; and they did evil things in the land. <span class="verse" id="v53">53</span> They made Israel to hide themselves in every place of refuge which they had.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v54">54</span> On the fifteenth day of Chislev, in<a href="#FN15" class="notemark" title=" circa B.C. 168. See 2 Maccabees 5:11. ">§</a> the one hundred forty fifth year, they built an abomination of desolation upon the altar,<a href="#FN16" class="notemark" title=" The two words rendered altar are different in the Greek: and so in 1 Maccabees 1:59. ">†</a> and in the cities of Judah on every side they built idol altars.<a href="#FN17" class="notemark" title=" The two words rendered altar are different in the Greek: and so in 1 Maccabees 1:59. ">‡</a> <span class="verse" id="v55">55</span> At the doors of the houses and in the streets they burned incense. <span class="verse" id="v56">56</span> They tore the books of the law which they found in pieces and set them on fire. <span class="verse" id="v57">57</span> Anyone who was found with any a book of the covenant, and if any consented to the law, the king’s sentence delivered him to death. <span class="verse" id="v58">58</span> Thus did they in their might to Israel, to those who were found month by month in the cities. <span class="verse" id="v59">59</span> On the twenty-fifth day of the month they sacrificed upon the idol altar that was on top of the altar of burnt offering. <span class="verse" id="v60">60</span> <a href="#FN18" class="notemark" title=" See 2 Maccabees 6:10.">§</a>They put to death women who had circumcised their children, according to the commandment. <span class="verse" id="v61">61</span> They hung their babies around their necks, and their houses, and those who had circumcised them. <span class="verse" id="v62">62</span> Many in Israel were fully resolved and confirmed in themselves not to eat unclean things. <span class="verse" id="v63">63</span> <a href="#FN19" class="notemark" title=" See 2 Maccabees 6:19 and 7:1, etc. ">†</a>They chose to die, that they might not be defiled with the food, and that they might not profane the holy covenant; and they died. <span class="verse" id="v64">64</span> Exceedingly great wrath came upon Israel.</p>
