    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v7">7</span> “On the table of show bread they shall spread a blue cloth, and put on it the dishes, the spoons, the bowls, and the cups with which to pour out; and the continual bread shall be on it. <span class="verse" id="v8">8</span> They shall spread on them a scarlet cloth, and cover it with a covering of sealskin, and shall put in its poles.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v9">9</span> “They shall take a blue cloth and cover the lamp stand of the light, its lamps, its snuffers, its snuff dishes, and all its oil vessels, with which they minister to it. <span class="verse" id="v10">10</span> They shall put it and all its vessels within a covering of sealskin, and shall put it on the frame.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v11">11</span> “On the golden altar they shall spread a blue cloth, and cover it with a covering of sealskin, and shall put in its poles.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v12">12</span> “They shall take all the vessels of ministry with which they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a blue cloth, cover them with a covering of sealskin, and shall put them on the frame.</p>

    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v15">15</span> “When Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all the furniture of the sanctuary, as the camp moves forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to carry it; but they shall not touch the sanctuary, lest they die. The sons of Kohath shall carry these things belonging to the Tent of Meeting.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v16">16</span> “The duty of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be the oil for the light, the sweet incense, the continual meal offering, and the anointing oil, the requirements of all the tabernacle, and of all that is in it, the sanctuary, and its furnishings.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v17">17</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, <span class="verse" id="v18">18</span> “Don’t cut off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites; <span class="verse" id="v19">19</span> but do this to them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in and appoint everyone to his service and to his burden; <span class="verse" id="v20">20</span> but they shall not go in to see the sanctuary even for a moment, lest they die.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v21">21</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span class="verse" id="v22">22</span> “Take a census of the sons of Gershon also, by their fathers’ houses, by their families; <span class="verse" id="v23">23</span> you shall count them from thirty years old and upward until fifty years old: all who enter in to wait on the service, to do the work in the Tent of Meeting.</p>

They shall serve in there. <span class="verse" id="v27">27</span> At the commandment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burden and in all their service; and you shall appoint their duty to them in all their responsibilities. <span class="verse" id="v28">28</span> This is the service of the families of the sons of the Gershonites in the Tent of Meeting. Their duty shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v29">29</span> “As for the sons of Merari, you shall count them by their families, by their fathers’ houses; <span class="verse" id="v30">30</span> you shall count them from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old—everyone who enters on the service, to do the work of the Tent of Meeting. <span class="verse" id="v31">31</span> This is the duty of their burden, according to all their service in the Tent of Meeting: the tabernacle’s boards, its bars, its pillars, its sockets, <span class="verse" id="v32">32</span> the pillars of the court around it, their sockets, their pins, their cords, with all their instruments, and with all their service. You shall appoint the instruments of the duty of their burden to them by name. <span class="verse" id="v33">33</span> This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according to all their service in the Tent of Meeting, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v34">34</span> Moses and Aaron and the princes of the congregation counted the sons of the Kohathites by their families, and by their fathers’ houses, <span class="verse" id="v35">35</span> from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered into the service for work in the Tent of Meeting. <span class="verse" id="v36">36</span> Those who were counted of them by their families were two thousand seven hundred fifty. <span class="verse" id="v37">37</span> These are those who were counted of the families of the Kohathites, all who served in the Tent of Meeting, whom Moses and Aaron counted according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.</p>

    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v42">42</span> Those who were counted of the families of the sons of Merari, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, <span class="verse" id="v43">43</span> from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old—everyone who entered into the service for work in the Tent of Meeting, <span class="verse" id="v44">44</span> even those who were counted of them by their families, were three thousand two hundred. <span class="verse" id="v45">45</span> These are those who were counted of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron counted according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v46">46</span> All those who were counted of the Levites whom Moses and Aaron and the princes of Israel counted, by their families and by their fathers’ houses, <span class="verse" id="v47">47</span> from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered in to do the work of service and the work of bearing burdens in the Tent of Meeting, <span class="verse" id="v48">48</span> even those who were counted of them, were eight thousand five hundred eighty. <span class="verse" id="v49">49</span> According to the commandment of Yahweh they were counted by Moses, everyone according to his service and according to his burden.
