    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v52">52</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span class="verse" id="v53">53</span> “To these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names. <span class="verse" id="v54">54</span> To the more you shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance. To everyone according to those who were counted of him shall his inheritance be given. <span class="verse" id="v55">55</span> Notwithstanding, the land shall be divided by lot. According to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit. <span class="verse" id="v56">56</span> According to the lot shall their inheritance be divided between the more and the fewer.”</p>
