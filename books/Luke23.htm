    <h2 class="chapterlabel">23</h2>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v1">1</span> The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate. <span class="verse" id="v2">2</span> They began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v3">3</span> Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”</p>
    <p class="p">He answered him, <span class="wj">“So you say.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v4">4</span> Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v5">5</span> But they insisted, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v6">6</span> But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean. <span class="verse" id="v7">7</span> When he found out that he was in Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v8">8</span> Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him. <span class="verse" id="v9">9</span> He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers. <span class="verse" id="v10">10</span> The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him. <span class="verse" id="v11">11</span> Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate. <span class="verse" id="v12">12</span> Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v13">13</span> Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people, <span class="verse" id="v14">14</span> and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and behold, having examined him before you, I found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him. <span class="verse" id="v15">15</span> Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him. <span class="verse" id="v16">16</span> I will therefore chastise him and release him.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v17">17</span> Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark" title=" NU omits verse 17.">†</a> <span class="verse" id="v18">18</span> But they all cried out together, saying, “Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!”— <span class="verse" id="v19">19</span> one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v20">20</span> Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus, <span class="verse" id="v21">21</span> but they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v22">22</span> He said to them the third time, “Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him.” <span class="verse" id="v23">23</span> But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed. <span class="verse" id="v24">24</span> Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done. <span class="verse" id="v25">25</span> He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v26">26</span> When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid the cross on him to carry it after Jesus. <span class="verse" id="v27">27</span> A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him. <span class="verse" id="v28">28</span> But Jesus, turning to them, said, <span class="wj">“Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. </span> <span class="verse" id="v29">29</span> <span class="wj">For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’ </span> <span class="verse" id="v30">30</span> <span class="wj">Then they will begin to tell the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and tell the hills, ‘Cover us.’</span><a href="#FN2" class="notemark" title=" Hosea 10:8">*</a> <span class="verse" id="v31">31</span> <span class="wj">For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v32">32</span> There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death. <span class="verse" id="v33">33</span> When they came to the place that is called “The Skull”, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v34">34</span> Jesus said, <span class="wj">“Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.”</span></p>
    <p class="p">Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots. <span class="verse" id="v35">35</span> The people stood watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v36">36</span> The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar, <span class="verse" id="v37">37</span> and saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v38">38</span> An inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: “THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v39">39</span> One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, “If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v40">40</span> But the other answered, and rebuking him said, “Don’t you even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation? <span class="verse" id="v41">41</span> And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.” <span class="verse" id="v42">42</span> He said to Jesus, “Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v43">43</span> Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v44">44</span> It was now about the sixth hour,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark" title=" Time was counted from sunrise, so the sixth hour was about noon.">‡</a> and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.<a href="#FN4" class="notemark" title=" 3:00 p.m.">§</a> <span class="verse" id="v45">45</span> The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two. <span class="verse" id="v46">46</span> Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, <span class="wj">“Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!”</span> Having said this, he breathed his last.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v47">47</span> When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, “Certainly this was a righteous man.” <span class="verse" id="v48">48</span> All the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned home beating their breasts. <span class="verse" id="v49">49</span> All his acquaintances and the women who followed with him from Galilee stood at a distance, watching these things.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v50">50</span> Behold, there was a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man <span class="verse" id="v51">51</span> (he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also waiting for God’s Kingdom. <span class="verse" id="v52">52</span> This man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body. <span class="verse" id="v53">53</span> He took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid. <span class="verse" id="v54">54</span> It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near. <span class="verse" id="v55">55</span> The women who had come with him out of Galilee followed after, and saw the tomb and how his body was laid. <span class="verse" id="v56">56</span> They returned and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</p>
