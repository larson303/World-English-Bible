    <h2 class="chapterlabel">11</h2>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v1">1</span> Now faith is assurance of things hoped for, proof of things not seen. <span class="verse" id="v2">2</span> For by this, the elders obtained approval. <span class="verse" id="v3">3</span> By faith we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v4">4</span> By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had testimony given to him that he was righteous, God testifying with respect to his gifts; and through it he, being dead, still speaks.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v5">5</span> By faith Enoch was taken away, so that he wouldn’t see death, and he was not found, because God translated him. For he has had testimony given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to God. <span class="verse" id="v6">6</span> Without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him, for he who comes to God must believe that he exists, and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v7">7</span> By faith Noah, being warned about things not yet seen, moved with godly fear,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark" title=" or, reverence">†</a> prepared a ship for the saving of his house, through which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v8">8</span> By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out to the place which he was to receive for an inheritance. He went out, not knowing where he went. <span class="verse" id="v9">9</span> By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a land not his own, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise. <span class="verse" id="v10">10</span> For he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v11">11</span> By faith even Sarah herself received power to conceive, and she bore a child when she was past age, since she counted him faithful who had promised. <span class="verse" id="v12">12</span> Therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore, were fathered by one man, and him as good as dead.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v13">13</span> These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen<a href="#FN2" class="notemark" title=" TR adds “and being convinced of”">‡</a> them and embraced them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. <span class="verse" id="v14">14</span> For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own. <span class="verse" id="v15">15</span> If indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had enough time to return. <span class="verse" id="v16">16</span> But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v17">17</span> By faith, Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac. Yes, he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his only born<a href="#FN3" class="notemark" title=" The phrase “only born” is from the Greek word “μονογενη”, which is sometimes translated “only begotten” or “one and only”.">§</a> son, <span class="verse" id="v18">18</span> to whom it was said, “Your offspring will be accounted as from Isaac,” <a href="#FN4" class="notemark" title=" Genesis 21:12">*</a> <span class="verse" id="v19">19</span> concluding that God is able to raise up even from the dead. Figuratively speaking, he also did receive him back from the dead.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v20">20</span> By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v21">21</span> By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v22">22</span> By faith Joseph, when his end was near, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel, and gave instructions concerning his bones.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v23">23</span> By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v24">24</span> By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, <span class="verse" id="v25">25</span> choosing rather to share ill treatment with God’s people than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time, <span class="verse" id="v26">26</span> considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked to the reward. <span class="verse" id="v27">27</span> By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible. <span class="verse" id="v28">28</span> By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v29">29</span> By faith they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land. When the Egyptians tried to do so, they were swallowed up.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v30">30</span> By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v31">31</span> By faith Rahab the prostitute didn’t perish with those who were disobedient, having received the spies in peace.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v32">32</span> What more shall I say? For the time would fail me if I told of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets— <span class="verse" id="v33">33</span> who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked out righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,<a href="#FN5" class="notemark" title=" Daniel 6:22-23">*</a> <span class="verse" id="v34">34</span> quenched the power of fire,<a href="#FN6" class="notemark" title=" Daniel 3:1-30">*</a> escaped the edge of the sword,<a href="#FN7" class="notemark" title=" 1 Kings 19:1-3; 2 Kings 6:31—7:20">*</a> from weakness were made strong, grew mighty in war, and caused foreign armies to flee. <span class="verse" id="v35">35</span> Women received their dead by resurrection.<a href="#FN8" class="notemark" title=" 1 Kings 17:17-23; 2 Kings 4:32-37">*</a> Others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection. <span class="verse" id="v36">36</span> Others were tried by mocking and scourging, yes, moreover by bonds and imprisonment. <span class="verse" id="v37">37</span> They were stoned.<a href="#FN9" class="notemark" title=" 2 Chronicles 24:20-21">*</a> They were sawn apart. They were tempted. They were slain with the sword.<a href="#FN10" class="notemark" title=" Jeremiah 26:20-23; 1 Kings 19:10">*</a> They went around in sheep skins and in goat skins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated— <span class="verse" id="v38">38</span> of whom the world was not worthy—wandering in deserts, mountains, caves, and the holes of the earth.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v39">39</span> These all, having been commended for their faith, didn’t receive the promise, <span class="verse" id="v40">40</span> God having provided some better thing concerning us, so that apart from us they should not be made perfect.</p>
