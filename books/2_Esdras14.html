    <h2 class="chapterlabel">14</h2>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v1">1</span> It came to pass upon the third day, I sat under an oak, and, behold, a voice came out of a bush near me, and said, “Esdras, Esdras!”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v2">2</span> I said, “Here I am, Lord,” and I stood up on my feet.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v3">3</span> Then he said to me, “I revealed myself in a bush and talked with Moses when my people were in bondage in Egypt. <span class="verse" id="v4">4</span> I sent him, and <a href="#FN1" class="notemark" title=" Another reading is. I. ">†</a> he led my people out of Egypt. I brought him up to Mount Sinai, where I kept him with me for many days. <span class="verse" id="v5">5</span> I told him many wondrous things, and showed him the secrets of the times and the end of the seasons. I commanded him, saying, <span class="verse" id="v6">6</span> ‘You shall publish these openly, and these you shall hide.’ <span class="verse" id="v7">7</span> Now I say to you: <span class="verse" id="v8">8</span> Lay up in your heart the signs that I have shown, the dreams that you have seen, and the interpretations which you have heard; <span class="verse" id="v9">9</span> for you will be taken away from men, and from now on you will live with my Son and with those who are like you, until the times have ended. <span class="verse" id="v10">10</span> For the world has lost its youth, and the times begin to grow old. <span class="verse" id="v11">11</span> <a href="#FN2" class="notemark" title=" Verses 11, 12 are omitted in the Syriac. The Aethiopic has For the age is divided into ten parts, and is come to the tenth: and half of the tenth remains. Now etc. ">‡</a>For the age is divided into twelve parts, and ten parts of it are already gone, <a href="#FN3" class="notemark" title=" Lat. and. ">§</a>even the half of the tenth part. <span class="verse" id="v12">12</span> There remain of it two parts after the middle of the tenth part. <span class="verse" id="v13">13</span> Now therefore set your house in order, reprove your people, comfort the lowly among them, <a href="#FN4" class="notemark" title=" The Latin alone omits and...wise. ">†</a> and instruct those of them who are wise, and now renounce the life that is corruptible, <span class="verse" id="v14">14</span> and let go of the mortal thoughts, cast away from you the burdens of man, put off now your weak nature, <span class="verse" id="v15">15</span> lay aside the thoughts that are most grievous to you, and hurry to escape from these times. <span class="verse" id="v16">16</span> For worse evils than those which you have seen happen will be done after this. <span class="verse" id="v17">17</span> For look how much the world will be weaker through age, so much that more evils will increase on those who dwell in it. <span class="verse" id="v18">18</span> For the truth will withdraw itself further off, and falsehood will be near. For now <a href="#FN5" class="notemark" title=" So the Oriental versions. ">‡</a>the eagle which you saw in vision hurries to come.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v19">19</span> Then I answered and said, <a href="#FN6" class="notemark" title=" The Latin omits I will speak. ">§</a>“Let me speak in your presence, O Lord. <span class="verse" id="v20">20</span> Behold, I will go, as you have commanded me, and reprove the people who now live, but who will warn those who will be born afterward? For the world is set in darkness, and those who dwell in it are without light. <span class="verse" id="v21">21</span> For your law has been burned, therefore no one knows the things that are done by you, or the works that will be done. <span class="verse" id="v22">22</span> But if I have found favor before you, send the Holy Spirit to me, and I will write all that has been done in the world since the beginning, even the things that were written in your law, that men may be able to find the path, and that those who would live in the latter days may live.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v23">23</span> He answered me and said, “Go your way, gather the people together, and tell them not to seek you for forty days. <span class="verse" id="v24">24</span> But prepare for yourself many tablets, and take with you Sarea, Dabria, Selemia, Ethanus, and Asiel, these five, which are ready to write swiftly; <span class="verse" id="v25">25</span> and come here, and I will light a lamp of understanding in your heart which will not be put out until the things have ended about which you will write. <span class="verse" id="v26">26</span> When you are done, some things you shall publish openly, and some things you shall deliver in secret to the wise. Tomorrow at this hour you will begin to write.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v27">27</span> Then went I out, as he commanded me, and gathered all the people together, and said, <span class="verse" id="v28">28</span> “Hear these words, O Israel! <span class="verse" id="v29">29</span> Our fathers at the beginning were foreigners in Egypt, and they were delivered from there, <span class="verse" id="v30">30</span> and received the law of life, which they didn’t keep, which you also have transgressed after them. <span class="verse" id="v31">31</span> Then the land of Zion was given to you for a possession; but you yourselves and your ancestors have done unrighteousness, and have not kept the ways which the Most High commanded you. <span class="verse" id="v32">32</span> Because he is a righteous judge, in due time, he took from you what he had given you. <span class="verse" id="v33">33</span> Now you are here, and your kindred are among you. <span class="verse" id="v34">34</span> Therefore if you will rule over your own understanding and instruct your hearts, you will be kept alive, and after death you will obtain mercy. <span class="verse" id="v35">35</span> For after death the judgment will come, when we will live again. Then the names of the righteous will become manifest, and the works of the ungodly will be declared. <span class="verse" id="v36">36</span> Let no one therefore come to me now, nor seek me for forty days.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v37">37</span> So I took the five men, as he commanded me, and we went out into the field, and remained there. <span class="verse" id="v38">38</span> It came to pass on the next day that, behold, a voice called me, saying, “Esdras, open your mouth, and drink what I give you to drink.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v39">39</span> Then opened I my mouth, and behold, a full cup was handed to me. It was full of something like water, but its color was like fire. <span class="verse" id="v40">40</span> I took it, and drank. When I had drunk it, my heart uttered understanding, and wisdom grew in my breast, for my spirit retained its memory. <span class="verse" id="v41">41</span> My mouth was opened, and shut no more. <span class="verse" id="v42">42</span> The Most High gave understanding to the five men, and they wrote by course the things that were told them, in <a href="#FN7" class="notemark" title=" So the Oriental versions. ">†</a>characters which they didn’t know, and they sat forty days. Now they wrote in the day-time, and at night they ate bread. <span class="verse" id="v43">43</span> As for me, I spoke in the day, and by night I didn’t hold my tongue. <span class="verse" id="v44">44</span> So in forty days, ninety-four books were written.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v45">45</span> It came to pass, when the forty days were fulfilled, that the Most High spoke to me, saying, “The first books that you have written, publish openly, and let the worthy and unworthy read them; <span class="verse" id="v46">46</span> but keep the last seventy, that you may deliver them to those who are wise among your people; <span class="verse" id="v47">47</span> for in them is the spring of understanding, the fountain of wisdom, and the stream of knowledge.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v48">48</span> I did so.</p>
