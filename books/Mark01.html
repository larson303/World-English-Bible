    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v1">1</span> The beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v2">2</span> As it is written in the prophets,</p>
    <p class="q">“Behold,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark" title=" “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.">†</a> I send my messenger before your face,</p>
    <p class="q2">who will prepare your way before you:<a href="#FN2" class="notemark" title=" Malachi 3:1">*</a></p>
    <p class="q"><span class="verse" id="v3">3</span> the voice of one crying in the wilderness,</p>
    <p class="q2">‘Make ready the way of the Lord!</p>
    <p class="q2">Make his paths straight!’ ”<a href="#FN3" class="notemark" title=" Isaiah 40:3">*</a></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v4">4</span> John came baptizing<a href="#FN4" class="notemark" title=" or, immersing">‡</a> in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins. <span class="verse" id="v5">5</span> All the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins. <span class="verse" id="v6">6</span> John was clothed with camel’s hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey. <span class="verse" id="v7">7</span> He preached, saying, “After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen. <span class="verse" id="v8">8</span> I baptized you in<a href="#FN5" class="notemark" title=" The Greek word (en) translated here as “in” could also be translated as “with” in some contexts.">§</a> water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v9">9</span> In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan. <span class="verse" id="v10">10</span> Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. <span class="verse" id="v11">11</span> A voice came out of the sky, “You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v12">12</span> Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness. <span class="verse" id="v13">13</span> He was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels were serving him.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v14">14</span> Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Good News of God’s Kingdom, <span class="verse" id="v15">15</span> and saying, <span class="wj">“The time is fulfilled, and God’s Kingdom is at hand! Repent, and believe in the Good News.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v16">16</span> Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. <span class="verse" id="v17">17</span> Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v18">18</span> Immediately they left their nets, and followed him.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v19">19</span> Going on a little further from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets. <span class="verse" id="v20">20</span> Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v21">21</span> They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught. <span class="verse" id="v22">22</span> They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes. <span class="verse" id="v23">23</span> Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, <span class="verse" id="v24">24</span> saying, “Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: the Holy One of God!”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v25">25</span> Jesus rebuked him, saying, <span class="wj">“Be quiet, and come out of him!” </span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v26">26</span> The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. <span class="verse" id="v27">27</span> They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!” <span class="verse" id="v28">28</span> The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v29">29</span> Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. <span class="verse" id="v30">30</span> Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her. <span class="verse" id="v31">31</span> He came and took her by the hand and raised her up. The fever left her immediately,<a href="#FN6" class="notemark" title=" NU omits “immediately”.">†</a> and she served them.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v32">32</span> At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick and those who were possessed by demons. <span class="verse" id="v33">33</span> All the city was gathered together at the door. <span class="verse" id="v34">34</span> He healed many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons. He didn’t allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v35">35</span> Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted place, and prayed there. <span class="verse" id="v36">36</span> Simon and those who were with him searched for him. <span class="verse" id="v37">37</span> They found him and told him, “Everyone is looking for you.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v38">38</span> He said to them, <span class="wj">“Let’s go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also, because I came out for this reason.”</span> <span class="verse" id="v39">39</span> He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v40">40</span> A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, “If you want to, you can make me clean.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v41">41</span> Being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, <span class="wj">“I want to. Be made clean.”</span> <span class="verse" id="v42">42</span> When he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was made clean. <span class="verse" id="v43">43</span> He strictly warned him and immediately sent him out, <span class="verse" id="v44">44</span> and said to him, <span class="wj">“See that you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v45">45</span> But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places. People came to him from everywhere.</p>
