    <h2 class="chapterlabel">10</h2>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v1">1</span> In the one hundred sixtieth year,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark" title=" circa B.C. 153. ">†</a> Alexander Epiphanes, the son of Antiochus, went up and took possession of Ptolemais. They received him, and he reigned there. <span class="verse" id="v2">2</span> King Demetrius heard about this, and he gathered together exceedingly great forces, and went out to meet him in battle.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v3">3</span> Demetrius sent a letter to Jonathan with words of peace, so as to honor him. <span class="verse" id="v4">4</span> For he said, “Let’s go beforehand to make peace with them, before he makes peace with Alexander against us; <span class="verse" id="v5">5</span> for he will remember all the evils that we have done against him, and to his kindred and to his nation.” <span class="verse" id="v6">6</span> So he gave him authority to gather together forces, and to provide weapons, and that he should be his ally. He also commanded that they should release the hostages that were in the citadel to him.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v7">7</span> Jonathan came to Jerusalem, and read the letter in the hearing of all the people, and of those who were in the citadel. <span class="verse" id="v8">8</span> They were very afraid when they heard that the king had given him authority to gather together an army. <span class="verse" id="v9">9</span> Those in the citadel released the hostages to Jonathan, and he restored them to their parents.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v10">10</span> Jonathan lived in Jerusalem and began to build and renew the city. <span class="verse" id="v11">11</span> He commanded those who did the work to build the walls and encircle Mount Zion with<a href="#FN2" class="notemark" title=" So the versions and Josephus. Gr. four-foot stones. ">‡</a> square stones for defense; and they did so. <span class="verse" id="v12">12</span> The foreigners who were in the strongholds which Bacchides had built fled away. <span class="verse" id="v13">13</span> Each man left his place and departed into his own land. <span class="verse" id="v14">14</span> Only at Bethsura, there were left some of those who had forsaken the law and the commandments, for it was a place of refuge to them.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v15">15</span> King Alexander heard all the promises which Demetrius had sent to Jonathan. They told him of the battles and the valiant deeds which he and his kindred had done, and of the troubles which they had endured. <span class="verse" id="v16">16</span> So he said, “Could we find another man like him? Now we will make him our<a href="#FN3" class="notemark" title=" See 1 Maccabees 2:18. Compare 1 Maccabees 10:65. ">§</a> friend and ally.” <span class="verse" id="v17">17</span> He wrote a letter and sent it to him, in these words, saying, <span class="verse" id="v18">18</span> “King Alexander to his brother Jonathan, greetings. <span class="verse" id="v19">19</span> We have heard of you, that you are a mighty man of valour, and worthy to be our<a href="#FN4" class="notemark" title=" See 1 Maccabees 2:18. Compare 1 Maccabees 10:65. ">†</a> friend. <span class="verse" id="v20">20</span> Now we have appointed you this day to be high priest of your nation, and to be called the king’s<a href="#FN5" class="notemark" title=" See 1 Maccabees 2:18. Compare 1 Maccabees 10:65. ">‡</a> friend, and to take our side, and to keep friendship with us.” He also sent to him a purple robe and a golden crown.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v21">21</span> And Jonathan put on the holy garments in the seventh month of the one hundred sixtieth year,<a href="#FN6" class="notemark" title=" circa B.C. 153. ">§</a> at the feast of tabernacles; and he gathered together forces and provided weapons in abundance.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v22">22</span> When Demetrius heard these things, he was grieved and said, <span class="verse" id="v23">23</span> “What is this that we have done, that Alexander has gotten ahead of us in establishing friendship with the Jews to strengthen himself? <span class="verse" id="v24">24</span> I also will write to them words of encouragement and of honor and of gifts, that they may be with me to aid me.” <span class="verse" id="v25">25</span> So he sent to them this message:</p>
    <p class="p">“King Demetrius to the nation of the Jews, greetings. <span class="verse" id="v26">26</span> Since as you have kept your covenants with us, and continued in our friendship, and have not joined yourselves to our enemies, we have heard of this, and are glad. <span class="verse" id="v27">27</span> Now continue still to keep faith with us, and we will repay you with good in return for your dealings with us. <span class="verse" id="v28">28</span> We will grant you many immunities and give you gifts.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v29">29</span> “Now I free you and release all the Jews from the tributes, from the salt tax, and from the crown levies. <span class="verse" id="v30">30</span> Instead of the third part of the seed, and instead of half of the fruit of the trees, which falls to me to receive, I release it from this day and henceforth, so that I will not take it from the land of Judah, and from the three districts which are added to it from the country of Samaria and Galilee, from this day forth and for all time. <span class="verse" id="v31">31</span> Let Jerusalem be holy and free, with her borders, tithes, and taxes. <span class="verse" id="v32">32</span> I yield up also my authority over the citadel which is at Jerusalem, and give it to the high priest, that he may appoint in it men whom he chooses to keep it. <span class="verse" id="v33">33</span> Every soul of the Jews who has been carried captive from the land of Judah into any part of my kingdom, I set at liberty without payment. Let all officials also cancel the taxes on their livestock.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v34">34</span> “All the feasts, the Sabbaths, new moons, appointed days, three days before a feast, and three days after a feast, let them all be days of immunity and release for all the Jews who are in my kingdom. <span class="verse" id="v35">35</span> No man shall have authority to exact anything from any of them, or to trouble them concerning any matter.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v36">36</span> “Let there be enrolled among the king’s forces about thirty thousand men of the Jews, and pay shall be given to them, as is due to all the king’s forces. <span class="verse" id="v37">37</span> Of them, some shall be placed in the king’s great strongholds, and some of them shall be placed over the affairs of the kingdom, which are positions of trust. Let those who are over them and their rulers be of themselves, and let them walk after their own laws, even as the king has commanded in the land of Judah.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v38">38</span> “The three districts that have been added to Judea from the country of Samaria, let them be annexed to Judea, that they may be reckoned to be under one ruler, that they may not obey any other authority than the high priest’s. <span class="verse" id="v39">39</span> As for Ptolemais and its land, I have given it as a gift to the sanctuary that is at Jerusalem, for the expenses of the sanctuary. <span class="verse" id="v40">40</span> I also give every year fifteen thousand shekels of silver from the king’s revenues from the places that are appropriate. <span class="verse" id="v41">41</span> And all the additional funds which those who manage the king’s affairs didn’t pay as in the first years, they shall give from now on toward the works of the temple. <span class="verse" id="v42">42</span> Besides this, the five thousand shekels of silver which they received from the uses of the sanctuary from the revenue year by year is also released, because it belongs to the priests who minister there. <span class="verse" id="v43">43</span> Whoever flees to the temple that is at Jerusalem, and within all of its borders, whether one owe money to the king, or any other matter, let them go free, along with all that they have in my kingdom. <span class="verse" id="v44">44</span> For the building and renewing of the structures of the sanctuary, the expense shall also be given out of the king’s revenue. <span class="verse" id="v45">45</span> For the building of the walls of Jerusalem and fortifying it all around, the expense shall also be given out of the king’s revenue, also for the building of the walls in Judea.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v46">46</span> Now when Jonathan and the people heard these words, they gave no credence to them, and didn’t accept them, because they remembered the great evil which he had done in Israel, and that he had afflicted them very severely. <span class="verse" id="v47">47</span> They were well pleased with Alexander, because he was the first who spoke words of peace to them, and they were allies with him always.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v48">48</span> King Alexander gathered together great forces and encamped near Demetrius. <span class="verse" id="v49">49</span> The two kings joined battle, and the army of Alexander fled; and Demetrius followed after him, and prevailed against them. <span class="verse" id="v50">50</span> He strengthened the battle exceedingly until the sun went down; and Demetrius fell that day.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v51">51</span> Alexander sent ambassadors to Ptolemy king of Egypt with this message: <span class="verse" id="v52">52</span> “Since I have returned to my kingdom, and am seated on the throne of my fathers, and have established my dominion, and have overthrown Demetrius, and have taken possession of our country— <span class="verse" id="v53">53</span> yes, I joined the battle with him, and he and his army were defeated by us, and we sat on the throne of his kingdom— <span class="verse" id="v54">54</span> now also let’s make friends with one another. Give me now your daughter as my wife. I will be joined with you, and will give both you and her gifts worthy of you.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v55">55</span> Ptolemy the king answered, saying, “Happy is the day you returned to the land of your ancestors and sat on the throne of their kingdom. <span class="verse" id="v56">56</span> Now I will do to you as you have written, but meet me at Ptolemais, that we may see one another; and I will join with you, even as you have said.” <span class="verse" id="v57">57</span> So Ptolemy went out of Egypt, himself and Cleopatra his daughter, and came to Ptolemais in the one hundred sixty-second year.<a href="#FN7" class="notemark" title=" circa B.C. 151. ">†</a> <span class="verse" id="v58">58</span> King Alexander met him, and he gave him his daughter Cleopatra, and celebrated her wedding at Ptolemais with great pomp, as kings do.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v59">59</span> King Alexander wrote to Jonathan, that he should come to meet him. <span class="verse" id="v60">60</span> He went with pomp to Ptolemais, and met the two kings. He gave them and their friends<a href="#FN8" class="notemark" title=" See 1 Maccabees 2:18. Compare 1 Maccabees 10:65. ">‡</a> silver and gold, and many gifts, and found favor in their sight. <span class="verse" id="v61">61</span> Some malcontents out of Israel, men who were transgressors of the law, gathered together against him to complain against him; but the king paid no attention to them. <span class="verse" id="v62">62</span> The king commanded that they take off Jonathan’s garments and clothe him in purple, and they did so. <span class="verse" id="v63">63</span> The king made him sit with him, and said to his princes, “Go out with him into the midst of the city, and proclaim that no man may complain against him of any matter, and let no man trouble him for any reason.” <span class="verse" id="v64">64</span> It came to pass, when those who complained against him saw his honor according to the proclamation, and saw him clothed in purple, they all fled away. <span class="verse" id="v65">65</span> The king gave him honor, and enrolled him among his chief friends,<a href="#FN9" class="notemark" title=" See 1 Maccabees 11:27; 2 Maccabees 8:9. Compare 1 Maccabees 2:18; 10:16, etc. ">§</a> and made him a captain and governor of a province. <span class="verse" id="v66">66</span> Then Jonathan returned to Jerusalem with peace and gladness.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v67">67</span> In the one hundred sixty-fifth year,<a href="#FN10" class="notemark" title=" circa B.C. 148. ">†</a> Demetrius, son of Demetrius, came out of Crete into the land of his ancestors. <span class="verse" id="v68">68</span> When King Alexander heard of it, he grieved exceedingly and returned to Antioch. <span class="verse" id="v69">69</span> Demetrius appointed Apollonius, who was over Coelesyria, and he gathered together a great army, and encamped against Jamnia, and sent to Jonathan the high priest, saying,</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v70">70</span> “You alone lift up yourself against us, but I am ridiculed and in reproach because of you. Why do you assume authority against us in the mountains? <span class="verse" id="v71">71</span> Now therefore, if you trust in your forces, come down to us into the plain, and let’s match strength with each other there; for the power of the cities is with me. <span class="verse" id="v72">72</span> Ask and learn who I am, and the rest who help us. They say, ‘Your foot can’t stand before our face; for your ancestors have been put to flight twice in their own land.’ <span class="verse" id="v73">73</span> Now you won’t be able to withstand the cavalry and such an army as this in the plain, where is there is no stone or pebble, or place to flee.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v74">74</span> Now when Jonathan heard the words of Apollonius, he was moved in his mind, and he chose ten thousand men, and went out from Jerusalem; and Simon his brother met him to help him. <span class="verse" id="v75">75</span> Then he encamped against Joppa. The people of the city shut him out, because Apollonius had a garrison in Joppa. <span class="verse" id="v76">76</span> So they fought against it. The people of the city were afraid, and opened to him; and Jonathan became master of Joppa.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v77">77</span> Apollonius heard about that, and he gathered an army of three thousand cavalry, and a great army, and went to Azotus as though he were on a journey, and at the same time advanced onward into the plain, because he had a multitude of cavalry which he trusted. <span class="verse" id="v78">78</span> He pursued him to Azotus, and the armies joined battle.<a href="#FN11" class="notemark" title=" Most of the authorities here repeat after him.">‡</a> <span class="verse" id="v79">79</span> Apollonius had secretly left a thousand cavalry behind them. <span class="verse" id="v80">80</span> Jonathan learned that there was an ambush behind him. They surrounded his army, and shot their arrows at the people, from morning until evening; <span class="verse" id="v81">81</span> but the people stood fast, as Jonathan commanded them; and the enemy’s horses grew tired.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v82">82</span> Then Simon brought forward his army and joined battle with the phalanx (for the cavalry were exhausted), and they were defeated by him and fled. <span class="verse" id="v83">83</span> The cavalry were scattered in the plain. They fled to Azotus and entered into Beth-dagon, their idol’s temple, to save themselves. <span class="verse" id="v84">84</span> Jonathan burned Azotus and the cities around it and took their spoils. He burned the temple of Dagon and those who fled into it with fire. <span class="verse" id="v85">85</span> Those who had fallen by the sword plus those who were burned were about eight thousand men.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v86">86</span> From there, Jonathan left and encamped against Ascalon. The people of the city came out to meet him with great pomp. <span class="verse" id="v87">87</span> Jonathan, with those who were on his side, returned to Jerusalem, having many spoils. <span class="verse" id="v88">88</span> It came to pass, when King Alexander heard these things, he honored Jonathan even more. <span class="verse" id="v89">89</span> He sent him a gold buckle, as the custom is to give to the king’s kindred. He gave him Ekron and all its land for a possession.</p>
