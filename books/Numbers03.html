    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v1">1</span> Now this is the history of the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that Yahweh spoke with Moses in Mount Sinai. <span class="verse" id="v2">2</span> These are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v3">3</span> These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests who were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest’s office. <span class="verse" id="v4">4</span> Nadab and Abihu died before Yahweh when they offered strange fire before Yahweh in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children. Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest’s office in the presence of Aaron their father.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v5">5</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span class="verse" id="v6">6</span> “Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister to him. <span class="verse" id="v7">7</span> They shall keep his requirements, and the requirements of the whole congregation before the Tent of Meeting, to do the service of the tabernacle. <span class="verse" id="v8">8</span> They shall keep all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting, and the obligations of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle. <span class="verse" id="v9">9</span> You shall give the Levites to Aaron and to his sons. They are wholly given to him on the behalf of the children of Israel. <span class="verse" id="v10">10</span> You shall appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall keep their priesthood, but the stranger who comes near shall be put to death.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v11">11</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span class="verse" id="v12">12</span> “Behold,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark" title=" “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at.

On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I made holy to me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and animal. They shall be mine. I am Yahweh.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v14">14</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying, <span class="verse" id="v15">15</span> “Count the children of Levi by their fathers’ houses, by their families. You shall count every male from a month old and upward.”</p>
