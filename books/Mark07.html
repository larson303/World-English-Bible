    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v1">1</span> Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem. <span class="verse" id="v2">2</span> Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is unwashed, hands, they found fault. <span class="verse" id="v3">3</span> (For the Pharisees and all the Jews don’t eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders. <span class="verse" id="v4">4</span> They don’t eat when they come from the marketplace unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.) <span class="verse" id="v5">5</span> The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why don’t your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v6">6</span> He answered them, <span class="wj">“Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,</span></p>
    <p class="q"><span class="wj">‘This people honors me with their lips,</span></p>
    <p class="q2"><span class="wj">but their heart is far from me.</span></p>

    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v8">8</span> <span class="wj">“For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men—the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things.”</span> <span class="verse" id="v9">9</span> He said to them, <span class="wj">“Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition. </span> <span class="verse" id="v10">10</span> <span class="wj">For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother;’</span><a href="#FN2" class="notemark" title=" Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16">*</a> <span class="wj">and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’</span><a href="#FN3" class="notemark" title=" Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9">*</a> <span class="verse" id="v11">11</span> <span class="wj">But you say, ‘If a man tells his father or his mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban,” ’ ”</span><a href="#FN4" class="notemark" title=" Corban is a Hebrew word for an offering devoted to God.">†</a> that is to say, given to God, <span class="verse" id="v12">12</span> <span class="wj">“then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother, </span> <span class="verse" id="v13">13</span> <span class="wj">making void the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down. You do many things like this.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v14">14</span> He called all the multitude to himself and said to them, <span class="wj">“Hear me, all of you, and understand. </span> <span class="verse" id="v15">15</span> <span class="wj">There is nothing from outside of the man that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man. </span> <span class="verse" id="v16">16</span> <span class="wj">If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!”</span><a href="#FN5" class="notemark" title=" NU omits verse 16.">‡</a></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v17">17</span> When he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable. <span class="verse" id="v18">18</span> He said to them, <span class="wj">“Are you also without understanding? Don’t you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can’t defile him, </span> <span class="verse" id="v19">19</span> <span class="wj">because it doesn’t go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, making all foods clean?”</span><a href="#FN6" class="notemark" title=" NU ends Jesus’ direct quote and question after “latrine”, ending the verse with “Thus he declared all foods clean. ">§</a> <span class="verse" id="v20">20</span> He said, <span class="wj">“That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man. </span> <span class="verse" id="v21">21</span> <span class="wj">For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts, </span> <span class="verse" id="v22">22</span> <span class="wj">covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness. </span> <span class="verse" id="v23">23</span> <span class="wj">All these evil things come from within and defile the man.” </span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v24">24</span> From there he arose and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house and didn’t want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape notice. <span class="verse" id="v25">25</span> For a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet. <span class="verse" id="v26">26</span> Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter. <span class="verse" id="v27">27</span> But Jesus said to her, <span class="wj">“Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.” </span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v28">28</span> But she answered him, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v29">29</span> He said to her, <span class="wj">“For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v30">30</span> She went away to her house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v31">31</span> Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee through the middle of the region of Decapolis. <span class="verse" id="v32">32</span> They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him. <span class="verse" id="v33">33</span> He took him aside from the multitude privately and put his fingers into his ears; and he spat and touched his tongue. <span class="verse" id="v34">34</span> Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, <span class="wj">“Ephphatha!” </span> that is, <span class="wj">“Be opened!”</span> <span class="verse" id="v35">35</span> Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly. <span class="verse" id="v36">36</span> He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it. <span class="verse" id="v37">37</span> They were astonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear and the mute speak!”</p>
