    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v1">1</span> Then the heads of fathers’ houses of the Levites came near to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of fathers’ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel. <span class="verse" id="v2">2</span> They spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, “Yahweh commanded through Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with their pasture lands for our livestock.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v3">3</span> The children of Israel gave to the Levites out of their inheritance, according to the commandment of Yahweh, these cities with their pasture lands. <span class="verse" id="v4">4</span> The lot came out for the families of the Kohathites. The children of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, had thirteen cities by lot out of the tribe of Judah, out of the tribe of the Simeonites, and out of the tribe of Benjamin. <span class="verse" id="v5">5</span> The rest of the children of Kohath had ten cities by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh. <span class="verse" id="v6">6</span> The children of Gershon had thirteen cities by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, out of the tribe of Asher, out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan. <span class="verse" id="v7">7</span> The children of Merari according to their families had twelve cities out of the tribe of Reuben, out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun. <span class="verse" id="v8">8</span> The children of Israel gave these cities with their pasture lands by lot to the Levites, as Yahweh commanded by Moses. <span class="verse" id="v9">9</span> They gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are mentioned by name: <span class="verse" id="v10">10</span> and they were for the children of Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi; for theirs was the first lot. <span class="verse" id="v11">11</span> They gave them Kiriath Arba, named after the father of Anak (also called Hebron), in the hill country of Judah, with its pasture lands around it. <span class="verse" id="v12">12</span> But they gave the fields of the city and its villages to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession. <span class="verse" id="v13">13</span> To the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with its pasture lands, the city of refuge for the man slayer, Libnah with its pasture lands, <span class="verse" id="v14">14</span> Jattir with its pasture lands, Eshtemoa with its pasture lands, <span class="verse" id="v15">15</span> Holon with its pasture lands, Debir with its pasture lands, <span class="verse" id="v16">16</span> Ain with its pasture lands, Juttah with its pasture lands, and Beth Shemesh with its pasture lands: nine cities out of those two tribes. <span class="verse" id="v17">17</span> Out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its pasture lands, Geba with its pasture lands, <span class="verse" id="v18">18</span> Anathoth with its pasture lands, and Almon with its pasture lands: four cities. <span class="verse" id="v19">19</span> All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their pasture lands.</p>

    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v27">27</span> They gave to the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the half-tribe of Manasseh Golan in Bashan with its pasture lands, the city of refuge for the man slayer, and Be Eshterah with its pasture lands: two cities. <span class="verse" id="v28">28</span> Out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishion with its pasture lands, Daberath with its pasture lands, <span class="verse" id="v29">29</span> Jarmuth with its pasture lands, En Gannim with its pasture lands: four cities. <span class="verse" id="v30">30</span> Out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its pasture lands, Abdon with its pasture lands, <span class="verse" id="v31">31</span> Helkath with its pasture lands, and Rehob with its pasture lands: four cities. <span class="verse" id="v32">32</span> Out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its pasture lands, the city of refuge for the man slayer, Hammothdor with its pasture lands, and Kartan with its pasture lands: three cities. <span class="verse" id="v33">33</span> All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their pasture lands.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v34">34</span> To the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its pasture lands, Kartah with its pasture lands, <span class="verse" id="v35">35</span> Dimnah with its pasture lands, and Nahalal with its pasture lands: four cities. <span class="verse" id="v36">36</span> Out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with its pasture lands, Jahaz with its pasture lands, <span class="verse" id="v37">37</span> Kedemoth with its pasture lands, and Mephaath with its pasture lands: four cities. <span class="verse" id="v38">38</span> Out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its pasture lands, the city of refuge for the man slayer, and Mahanaim with its pasture lands, <span class="verse" id="v39">39</span> Heshbon with its pasture lands, Jazer with its pasture lands: four cities in all. <span class="verse" id="v40">40</span> All these were the cities of the children of Merari according to their families, even the rest of the families of the Levites. Their lot was twelve cities.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v41">41</span> All the cities of the Levites among the possessions of the children of Israel were forty-eight cities with their pasture lands. <span class="verse" id="v42">42</span> Each of these cities included their pasture lands around them. It was this way with all these cities.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v43">43</span> So Yahweh gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give to their fathers. They possessed it, and lived in it. <span class="verse" id="v44">44</span> Yahweh gave them rest all around, according to all that he swore to their fathers. Not a man of all their enemies stood before them. Yahweh delivered all their enemies into their hand. <span class="verse" id="v45">45</span> Nothing failed of any good thing which Yahweh had spoken to the house of Israel. All came to pass.</p>
