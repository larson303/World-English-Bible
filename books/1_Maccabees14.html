    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v1">1</span> In the one hundred seventy-second year,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark" title=" circa B.C. 141. ">†</a> King Demetrius gathered his forces together, and went into Media to get help, that he might fight against Tryphon. <span class="verse" id="v2">2</span> When Arsaces, the king of Persia and Media, heard that Demetrius had come into his borders, he sent one of his princes to take him alive. <span class="verse" id="v3">3</span> He went and struck the army of Demetrius, and seized him and brought him to Arsaces, who put him under guard.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v4">4</span> The land had rest all the days of Simon. He sought the good of his nation. His authority and his honor was pleasing to them all his days. <span class="verse" id="v5">5</span> Amid all his honors, he took Joppa for a harbor, and made it an entrance for the islands of the sea. <span class="verse" id="v6">6</span> He enlarged the borders of his nation and took possession of the country. <span class="verse" id="v7">7</span> He gathered together a great number of captives, and took control of Gazara, Bethsura, and the citadel, and he removed its uncleannesses from it. There was no one who resisted him. <span class="verse" id="v8">8</span> They tilled their land in peace, and the land gave her increase, and the trees of the plains gave their fruit. <span class="verse" id="v9">9</span> The old men sat in the streets; they all conversed together about good things. The young men put on glorious and warlike apparel. <span class="verse" id="v10">10</span> He provided food for the cities and furnished them with means of defense, until the glory of his name was known to the end of the earth. <span class="verse" id="v11">11</span> He made peace in the land, and Israel rejoiced with great joy. <span class="verse" id="v12">12</span> Each man sat under his vine and his fig tree, and there was no one to make them afraid. <span class="verse" id="v13">13</span> No one was left in the land who fought against them. The kings were defeated in those days. <span class="verse" id="v14">14</span> He strengthened all those of his people who were humble. He searched out the law, and every lawless and wicked person he took away. <span class="verse" id="v15">15</span> He glorified the sanctuary, and added to the vessels of the temple.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v16">16</span> It was heard at Rome that Jonathan was dead, and even in Sparta, and they were exceedingly grieved. <span class="verse" id="v17">17</span> But as soon as they heard that his brother Simon was made high priest in his place, and ruled the country and the cities in it, <span class="verse" id="v18">18</span> they wrote to him on brass tablets to renew with him the friendship and the alliance which they had confirmed with his brothers Judas and Jonathan. <span class="verse" id="v19">19</span> These were read before the congregation at Jerusalem.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v20">20</span> This is the copy of the letters which the Spartans sent:</p>
    <p class="p">“The rulers and the city of the Spartans, to Simon the high priest, to the elders, the priests, and the rest of the people of the Jews, our kindred, greetings. <span class="verse" id="v21">21</span> The ambassadors who were sent to our people reported to us about your glory and honor. We were glad for their coming, <span class="verse" id="v22">22</span> and we registered the things that were spoken by them in the public records<a href="#FN2" class="notemark" title=" Gr. counsels of the people. ">‡</a> as follows: ‘Numenius son of Antiochus, and Antipater son of Jason, the Jews’ ambassadors, came to us to renew the friendship they had with us. <span class="verse" id="v23">23</span> It pleased the people to entertain the men honorably, and to put the copy of their words in the public records,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark" title=" Gr. books that are appointed for the people. ">§</a> to the end that the people of the Spartans might have a record of them. Moreover they wrote a copy of these things to Simon the high priest.’ ”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v24">24</span> After this, Simon sent Numenius to Rome with a great shield of gold of weighing one thousand minas,<a href="#FN4" class="notemark" title=" 1,000 minas is about 499 kg or 1,098 pounds. ">†</a> in order to confirm the alliance with them.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v25">25</span> But when the people heard these things, they said, “What thanks shall we give to Simon and his sons? <span class="verse" id="v26">26</span> For he and his brothers and the house of his father have made themselves strong, and have fought and chased away Israel’s enemies, and confirmed liberty to Israel.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark" title=" Gr. him. ">‡</a>” <span class="verse" id="v27">27</span> So they wrote on tablets of brass, and set them on pillars on mount Zion. This is the copy of the writing:</p>
    <p class="p">“On the eighteenth day of Elul, in the one hundred seventy-second year,<a href="#FN6" class="notemark" title=" circa B.C. 141. ">§</a> which is the third year of Simon the high priest, <span class="verse" id="v28">28</span> in Asaramel, in a great congregation of priests and people and princes of the nation, and of the elders of the country, it was proclaimed to us:<a href="#FN7" class="notemark" title=" Gr. he made known. ">†</a> <span class="verse" id="v29">29</span> ‘Since wars often occurred in the country, Simon the son of Mattathias, the son of the sons of Joarib, and his brothers, put themselves in jeopardy and withstood the enemies of their nation, that their sanctuary and the law might be established, and glorified their nation with great glory. <span class="verse" id="v30">30</span> Jonathan rallied the nation, became their high priest, and was gathered to his people. <span class="verse" id="v31">31</span> Their enemies planned to invade their country, that they might destroy their country utterly, and stretch out their hands against their sanctuary. <span class="verse" id="v32">32</span> Then Simon rose up and fought for his nation. He spent much of his own money to arm the valiant men of his nation and give them wages. <span class="verse" id="v33">33</span> He fortified the cities of Judea and Bethsura that lies on the borders of Judea, where the weapons of the enemies were had been stored, and there he placed a garrison of Jews. <span class="verse" id="v34">34</span> He fortified Joppa which is upon the sea, and Gazara which is upon the borders of Azotus, where the enemies used to live, and placed Jews there, and set in there all things necessary for their restoration. <span class="verse" id="v35">35</span> The people saw Simon’s faith,<a href="#FN8" class="notemark" title=" Some authorities read acts. ">‡</a> and the glory which he resolved to bring to his nation, and they made him their leader and high priest, because he had done all these things, and for the justice and the faith which he kept to his nation, and because he sought by all means to exalt his people. <span class="verse" id="v36">36</span> In his days, things prospered in his hands, so that the Gentiles were taken away out of their country, and they also who were in the city of David, those who were in Jerusalem, who had made themselves a citadel, out of which they used to go, and polluted everything around the sanctuary, and did great damage to its purity. <span class="verse" id="v37">37</span> He placed Jews in it and fortified it for the safety of the country and the city, and made high the walls of Jerusalem. <span class="verse" id="v38">38</span> King Demetrius confirmed to him the high priesthood according to these things, <span class="verse" id="v39">39</span> and made him one of his friends,<a href="#FN9" class="notemark" title=" See 1 Maccabees 2:18. ">§</a> and honored him with great honor; <span class="verse" id="v40">40</span> for he had heard that the Jews had been called by the Romans friends, allies, and kindred, and that they had met the ambassadors of Simon honorably; <span class="verse" id="v41">41</span> and that the Jews and the priests were well pleased that Simon should be their leader and high priest forever, until there should arise a faithful prophet; <span class="verse" id="v42">42</span> and that he should be governor over them, and should take charge of the sanctuary, to set them over their works, and over the country, and over the weapons, and over the strongholds; and that he should take charge of the sanctuary, <span class="verse" id="v43">43</span> and that he should be obeyed by all, and that all contracts in the country should be written in his name, and that he should be clothed in purple, and wear gold; <span class="verse" id="v44">44</span> and that it should not be lawful for any of the people or of the priests to nullify any of these things, or to oppose the words that he should speak, or to gather an assembly in the country without him, or to be clothed in purple, or wear a buckle of gold; <span class="verse" id="v45">45</span> but whoever should do otherwise, or nullify any of these things, he will be liable to punishment.’ ” <span class="verse" id="v46">46</span> All the people consented to ordain for Simon that he should do according to these words. <span class="verse" id="v47">47</span> So Simon accepted this, and consented to be high priest, and to be captain and governor<a href="#FN10" class="notemark" title=" Gr. ethnarch. ">†</a> of the Jews and of the priests, and to be protector of all.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v48">48</span> They commanded to put this writing on tablets of brass, and to set them up within the precinct of the sanctuary in a conspicuous place, <span class="verse" id="v49">49</span> and moreover to put copies of them in the treasury, so that Simon and his sons might have them.</p>
