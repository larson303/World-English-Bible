    <h2 class="chapterlabel">9</h2>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v1">1</span> As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth. <span class="verse" id="v2">2</span> His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v3">3</span> Jesus answered, <span class="wj">“This man didn’t sin, nor did his parents, but that the works of God might be revealed in him. </span> <span class="verse" id="v4">4</span> <span class="wj">I must work the works of him who sent me while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work. </span> <span class="verse" id="v5">5</span> <span class="wj">While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”</span> <span class="verse" id="v6">6</span> When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man’s eyes with the mud, <span class="verse" id="v7">7</span> and said to him, <span class="wj">“Go, wash in the pool of Siloam”</span> (which means “Sent”). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v8">8</span> Therefore the neighbors and those who saw that he was blind before said, “Isn’t this he who sat and begged?” <span class="verse" id="v9">9</span> Others were saying, “It is he.” Still others were saying, “He looks like him.”</p>
    <p class="p">He said, “I am he.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v10">10</span> They therefore were asking him, “How were your eyes opened?”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v11">11</span> He answered, “A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, <span class="wj">‘Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.’</span> So I went away and washed, and I received sight.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v12">12</span> Then they asked him, “Where is he?”</p>
    <p class="p">He said, “I don’t know.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v13">13</span> They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees. <span class="verse" id="v14">14</span> It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. <span class="verse" id="v15">15</span> Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, “He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v16">16</span> Some therefore of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, because he doesn’t keep the Sabbath.”</p>
    <p class="p">Others said, “How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” So there was division among them.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v17">17</span> Therefore they asked the blind man again, “What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?”</p>
    <p class="p">He said, “He is a prophet.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v18">18</span> The Jews therefore didn’t believe concerning him, that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight, <span class="verse" id="v19">19</span> and asked them, “Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v20">20</span> His parents answered them, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; <span class="verse" id="v21">21</span> but how he now sees, we don’t know; or who opened his eyes, we don’t know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself.” <span class="verse" id="v22">22</span> His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue. <span class="verse" id="v23">23</span> Therefore his parents said, “He is of age. Ask him.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v24">24</span> So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, “Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v25">25</span> He therefore answered, “I don’t know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v26">26</span> They said to him again, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v27">27</span> He answered them, “I told you already, and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don’t also want to become his disciples, do you?”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v28">28</span> They insulted him and said, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. <span class="verse" id="v29">29</span> We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as for this man, we don’t know where he comes from.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v30">30</span> The man answered them, “How amazing! You don’t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes. <span class="verse" id="v31">31</span> We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will, he listens to him.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark" title=" Psalm 66:18; Proverbs 15:29; 28:9">*</a> <span class="verse" id="v32">32</span> Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind. <span class="verse" id="v33">33</span> If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v34">34</span> They answered him, “You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?” Then they threw him out.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v35">35</span> Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, <span class="wj">“Do you believe in the Son of God?”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v36">36</span> He answered, “Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v37">37</span> Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v38">38</span> He said, “Lord, I believe!” and he worshiped him.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v39">39</span> Jesus said, <span class="wj">“I came into this world for judgment, that those who don’t see may see; and that those who see may become blind.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v40">40</span> Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, “Are we also blind?”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v41">41</span> Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, ‘We see.’ Therefore your sin remains.</span></p>
