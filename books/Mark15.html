    <h2 class="chapterlabel">15</h2>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v1">1</span> Immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders, scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, bound Jesus, carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate. <span class="verse" id="v2">2</span> Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”</p>
    <p class="p">He answered, <span class="wj">“So you say.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v3">3</span> The chief priests accused him of many things. <span class="verse" id="v4">4</span> Pilate again asked him, “Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v5">5</span> But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v6">6</span> Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whomever they asked of him. <span class="verse" id="v7">7</span> There was one called Barabbas, bound with his fellow insurgents, men who in the insurrection had committed murder. <span class="verse" id="v8">8</span> The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them. <span class="verse" id="v9">9</span> Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?” <span class="verse" id="v10">10</span> For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up. <span class="verse" id="v11">11</span> But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead. <span class="verse" id="v12">12</span> Pilate again asked them, “What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v13">13</span> They cried out again, “Crucify him!”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v14">14</span> Pilate said to them, “Why, what evil has he done?”</p>
    <p class="p">But they cried out exceedingly, “Crucify him!”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v15">15</span> Pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus, when he had flogged him, to be crucified.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v16">16</span> The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort. <span class="verse" id="v17">17</span> They clothed him with purple; and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him. <span class="verse" id="v18">18</span> They began to salute him, “Hail, King of the Jews!” <span class="verse" id="v19">19</span> They struck his head with a reed and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him. <span class="verse" id="v20">20</span> When they had mocked him, they took the purple cloak off him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v21">21</span> They compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them that he might bear his cross. <span class="verse" id="v22">22</span> They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, “The place of a skull.” <span class="verse" id="v23">23</span> They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn’t take it.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v24">24</span> Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take. <span class="verse" id="v25">25</span> It was the third hour<a href="#FN1" class="notemark" title=" 9:00 a.m.">†</a> when they crucified him. <span class="verse" id="v26">26</span> The superscription of his accusation was written over him: “THE KING OF THE JEWS.” <span class="verse" id="v27">27</span> With him they crucified two robbers, one on his right hand, and one on his left. <span class="verse" id="v28">28</span> The Scripture was fulfilled which says, “He was counted with transgressors.”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark" title=" NU omits verse 28.">‡</a></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v29">29</span> Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads and saying, “Ha! You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, <span class="verse" id="v30">30</span> save yourself, and come down from the cross!”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v31">31</span> Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, “He saved others. He can’t save himself. <span class="verse" id="v32">32</span> Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him.”<a href="#FN3" class="notemark" title=" TR omits “him”">§</a> Those who were crucified with him also insulted him.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v33">33</span> When the sixth hour<a href="#FN4" class="notemark" title=" or, noon">†</a> had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.<a href="#FN5" class="notemark" title=" 3:00 p.m.">‡</a> <span class="verse" id="v34">34</span> At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, <span class="wj">“Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?”</span> which is, being interpreted, <span class="wj">“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</span> <a href="#FN6" class="notemark" title=" Psalm 22:1">*</a></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v35">35</span> Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, “Behold, he is calling Elijah.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v36">36</span> One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to take him down.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v37">37</span> Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit. <span class="verse" id="v38">38</span> The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. <span class="verse" id="v39">39</span> When the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v40">40</span> There were also women watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome; <span class="verse" id="v41">41</span> who, when he was in Galilee, followed him and served him; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v42">42</span> When evening had now come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath, <span class="verse" id="v43">43</span> Joseph of Arimathaea, a prominent council member who also himself was looking for God’s Kingdom, came. He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body. <span class="verse" id="v44">44</span> Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead long. <span class="verse" id="v45">45</span> When he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph. <span class="verse" id="v46">46</span> He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. <span class="verse" id="v47">47</span> Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.</p>
