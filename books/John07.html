    <h2 class="chapterlabel">7</h2>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v1">1</span> After these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldn’t walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him. <span class="verse" id="v2">2</span> Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand. <span class="verse" id="v3">3</span> His brothers therefore said to him, “Depart from here and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do. <span class="verse" id="v4">4</span> For no one does anything in secret while he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.” <span class="verse" id="v5">5</span> For even his brothers didn’t believe in him.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v6">6</span> Jesus therefore said to them, <span class="wj">“My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready. </span> <span class="verse" id="v7">7</span> <span class="wj">The world can’t hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil. </span> <span class="verse" id="v8">8</span> <span class="wj">You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v9">9</span> Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee. <span class="verse" id="v10">10</span> But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret. <span class="verse" id="v11">11</span> The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, “Where is he?” <span class="verse" id="v12">12</span> There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, “He is a good man.” Others said, “Not so, but he leads the multitude astray.” <span class="verse" id="v13">13</span> Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews. <span class="verse" id="v14">14</span> But when it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught. <span class="verse" id="v15">15</span> The Jews therefore marveled, saying, “How does this man know letters, having never been educated?”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v16">16</span> Jesus therefore answered them, <span class="wj">“My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me. </span> <span class="verse" id="v17">17</span> <span class="wj">If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God or if I am speaking from myself. </span> <span class="verse" id="v18">18</span> <span class="wj">He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. </span> <span class="verse" id="v19">19</span> <span class="wj">Didn’t Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v20">20</span> The multitude answered, “You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v21">21</span> Jesus answered them, <span class="wj">“I did one work and you all marvel because of it. </span> <span class="verse" id="v22">22</span> <span class="wj">Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy. </span> <span class="verse" id="v23">23</span> <span class="wj">If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath? </span> <span class="verse" id="v24">24</span> <span class="wj">Don’t judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.” </span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v25">25</span> Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, “Isn’t this he whom they seek to kill? <span class="verse" id="v26">26</span> Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ? <span class="verse" id="v27">27</span> However, we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v28">28</span> Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, <span class="wj">“You both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you don’t know. </span> <span class="verse" id="v29">29</span> <span class="wj">I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v30">30</span> They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come. <span class="verse" id="v31">31</span> But of the multitude, many believed in him. They said, “When the Christ comes, he won’t do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?” <span class="verse" id="v32">32</span> The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v33">33</span> Then Jesus said, <span class="wj">“I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him who sent me. </span> <span class="verse" id="v34">34</span> <span class="wj">You will seek me and won’t find me. You can’t come where I am.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v35">35</span> The Jews therefore said among themselves, “Where will this man go that we won’t find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks? <span class="verse" id="v36">36</span> What is this word that he said, <span class="wj">‘You will seek me, and won’t find me;’</span> and <span class="wj">‘Where I am, you can’t come’</span>?”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v37">37</span> Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, <span class="wj">“If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink! </span> <span class="verse" id="v38">38</span> <span class="wj">He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water.”</span> <span class="verse" id="v39">39</span> But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn’t yet glorified.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v40">40</span> Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, “This is truly the prophet.” <span class="verse" id="v41">41</span> Others said, “This is the Christ.” But some said, “What, does the Christ come out of Galilee? <span class="verse" id="v42">42</span> Hasn’t the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the offspring<a href="#FN1" class="notemark" title=" or, seed">†</a> of David, <a href="#FN2" class="notemark" title=" 2 Samuel 7:12">*</a> and from Bethlehem,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark" title=" Micah 5:2">*</a> the village where David was?” <span class="verse" id="v43">43</span> So a division arose in the multitude because of him. <span class="verse" id="v44">44</span> Some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him. <span class="verse" id="v45">45</span> The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, “Why didn’t you bring him?”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v46">46</span> The officers answered, “No man ever spoke like this man!”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v47">47</span> The Pharisees therefore answered them, “You aren’t also led astray, are you? <span class="verse" id="v48">48</span> Have any of the rulers or any of the Pharisees believed in him? <span class="verse" id="v49">49</span> But this multitude that doesn’t know the law is cursed.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v50">50</span> Nicodemus (he who came to him by night, being one of them) said to them, <span class="verse" id="v51">51</span> “Does our law judge a man unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v52">52</span> They answered him, “Are you also from Galilee? Search and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee.”<a href="#FN4" class="notemark" title=" See Isaiah 9:1; Matthew 4:13-16">*</a></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v53">53</span> Everyone went to his own house,</p>
