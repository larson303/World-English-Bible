    <h2 class="chapterlabel">22</h2>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v1">1</span> Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching. <span class="verse" id="v2">2</span> The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death, for they feared the people.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v3">3</span> Satan entered into Judas, who was also called Iscariot, who was counted with the twelve. <span class="verse" id="v4">4</span> He went away and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them. <span class="verse" id="v5">5</span> They were glad, and agreed to give him money. <span class="verse" id="v6">6</span> He consented and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v7">7</span> The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed. <span class="verse" id="v8">8</span> Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, <span class="wj">“Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v9">9</span> They said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare?”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v10">10</span> He said to them, <span class="wj">“Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters. </span> <span class="verse" id="v11">11</span> <span class="wj">Tell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?” ’ </span> <span class="verse" id="v12">12</span> <span class="wj">He will show you a large, furnished upper room. Make preparations there.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v13">13</span> They went, found things as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v14">14</span> When the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve apostles. <span class="verse" id="v15">15</span> He said to them, <span class="wj">“I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer, </span> <span class="verse" id="v16">16</span> <span class="wj">for I tell you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in God’s Kingdom.”</span> <span class="verse" id="v17">17</span> He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, <span class="wj">“Take this and share it among yourselves, </span> <span class="verse" id="v18">18</span> <span class="wj">for I tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until God’s Kingdom comes.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v19">19</span> He took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke and gave it to them, saying, <span class="wj">“This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me.”</span> <span class="verse" id="v20">20</span> Likewise, he took the cup after supper, saying, <span class="wj">“This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you. </span> <span class="verse" id="v21">21</span> <span class="wj">But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table. </span> <span class="verse" id="v22">22</span> <span class="wj">The Son of Man indeed goes as it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v23">23</span> They began to question among themselves which of them it was who would do this thing.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v24">24</span> A dispute also arose among them, which of them was considered to be greatest. <span class="verse" id="v25">25</span> He said to them, <span class="wj">“The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called ‘benefactors.’ </span> <span class="verse" id="v26">26</span> <span class="wj">But not so with you. Rather, the one who is greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves. </span> <span class="verse" id="v27">27</span> <span class="wj">For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Isn’t it he who sits at the table? But I am among you as one who serves. </span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v28">28</span> <span class="wj">“But you are those who have continued with me in my trials. </span> <span class="verse" id="v29">29</span> <span class="wj">I confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred on me, </span> <span class="verse" id="v30">30</span> <span class="wj">that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v31">31</span> The Lord said, <span class="wj">“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have all of you, that he might sift you as wheat, </span> <span class="verse" id="v32">32</span> <span class="wj">but I prayed for you, that your faith wouldn’t fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers.”</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark" title=" The word for “brothers” here may be also correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”">†</a></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v33">33</span> He said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v34">34</span> He said, <span class="wj">“I tell you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me three times.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v35">35</span> He said to them, <span class="wj">“When I sent you out without purse, bag, and sandals, did you lack anything?”</span></p>
    <p class="p">They said, “Nothing.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v36">36</span> Then he said to them, <span class="wj">“But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a bag. Whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword. </span> <span class="verse" id="v37">37</span> <span class="wj">For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: ‘He was counted with transgressors.’</span><a href="#FN2" class="notemark" title=" Isaiah 53:12">*</a> <span class="wj">For that which concerns me is being fulfilled.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v38">38</span> They said, “Lord, behold, here are two swords.”</p>
    <p class="p">He said to them, <span class="wj">“That is enough.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v39">39</span> He came out and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him. <span class="verse" id="v40">40</span> When he was at the place, he said to them, <span class="wj">“Pray that you don’t enter into temptation.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v41">41</span> He was withdrawn from them about a stone’s throw, and he knelt down and prayed, <span class="verse" id="v42">42</span> saying, <span class="wj">“Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v43">43</span> An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him. <span class="verse" id="v44">44</span> Being in agony, he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v45">45</span> When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping because of grief, <span class="verse" id="v46">46</span> and said to them, <span class="wj">“Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v47">47</span> While he was still speaking, a crowd appeared. He who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him. <span class="verse" id="v48">48</span> But Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v49">49</span> When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?” <span class="verse" id="v50">50</span> A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v51">51</span> But Jesus answered, <span class="wj">“Let me at least do this”</span>—and he touched his ear and healed him. <span class="verse" id="v52">52</span> Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him, <span class="wj">“Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs? </span> <span class="verse" id="v53">53</span> <span class="wj">When I was with you in the temple daily, you didn’t stretch out your hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.” </span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v54">54</span> They seized him and led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter followed from a distance. <span class="verse" id="v55">55</span> When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat among them. <span class="verse" id="v56">56</span> A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, “This man also was with him.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v57">57</span> He denied Jesus, saying, “Woman, I don’t know him.”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v58">58</span> After a little while someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them!”</p>
    <p class="p">But Peter answered, “Man, I am not!”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v59">59</span> After about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, “Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean!”</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v60">60</span> But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you are talking about!” Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. <span class="verse" id="v61">61</span> The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the Lord’s word, how he said to him, <span class="wj">“Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times.”</span> <span class="verse" id="v62">62</span> He went out, and wept bitterly.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v63">63</span> The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him. <span class="verse" id="v64">64</span> Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, “Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?” <span class="verse" id="v65">65</span> They spoke many other things against him, insulting him.</p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v66">66</span> As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people were gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away into their council, saying, <span class="verse" id="v67">67</span> “If you are the Christ, tell us.”</p>
    <p class="p">But he said to them, <span class="wj">“If I tell you, you won’t believe, </span> <span class="verse" id="v68">68</span> <span class="wj">and if I ask, you will in no way answer me or let me go. </span> <span class="verse" id="v69">69</span> <span class="wj">From now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v70">70</span> They all said, “Are you then the Son of God?”</p>
    <p class="p">He said to them, <span class="wj">“You say it, because I am.”</span></p>
    <p class="p"><span class="verse" id="v71">71</span> They said, “Why do we need any more witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth!”</p>
